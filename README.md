# GaiaBH13DModel
A 3D Model of Gaia-BH1 Black Hole <br>

# Information on the Model
When a massive star runs out of fuel, it can no longer support itself against the force of gravity. This causes the star to collapse under its own weight. During this collapse, the core of the star gets compressed to an extremely small point, known as a singularity. This singularity has an incredibly strong gravitational pull.

The reason I modeled the black hole as a funnel is to help visualize how gravity works around a black hole. Imagine space as a stretched rubber sheet. When you place a heavy object on it, the sheet bends and creates a dip. The heavier the object, the deeper the dip. A black hole is like an extremely heavy object that creates a very deep and steep funnel in the fabric of space.

This funnel shape shows how the black hole warps space and time around it. Anything that gets too close to the edge of the funnel (the event horizon) will be pulled in and cannot escape, not even light. This is why black holes appear black.

Gaia-BH1 is a recently discovered black hole that has captured the interest of astronomers and scientists. Here are some key points about it:

1. Location: Gaia-BH1 is located in our Milky Way galaxy. It's relatively close to Earth in astronomical terms, making it an exciting object of study.

2. Discovery: This black hole was discovered using data from the Gaia space observatory, which is designed to map the positions and motions of stars with high precision.

3. Mass: Gaia-BH1 is a stellar-mass black hole, meaning it formed from the collapse of a massive star. Its mass is several times that of our Sun.

4. Event Horizon: Like all black holes, Gaia-BH1 has an event horizon. This is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull.

5. Gravitational Influence: The black hole's intense gravity affects nearby stars and gas, causing them to move in specific ways. By studying these movements, scientists can infer the presence and properties of the black hole.

6. Importance: Studying Gaia-BH1 helps scientists understand more about the life cycles of stars, the formation of black holes, and the dynamics of our galaxy.
